I've been using Python since 2019. I'm proficient in data cleaning, manipulation and visualization in Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. My work projects have consisted of developing and deploying ETL jobs working with AWS Services and working with API libaries to connect our data with SmartSheets. I'm also experienced in deploying projects using Docker and Poetry.
